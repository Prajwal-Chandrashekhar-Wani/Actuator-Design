# Actuator-Design
The Design Actuator in this project is created to perform precise, repeatable motion based on the system’s requirement—such as lifting, pushing or positioning mechanical components. It is engineered for compatibility with CAD assemblies and functional testing within simulation environments like SolidWorks and ANSYS.
